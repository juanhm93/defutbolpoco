# Suggest using `toBeCalledWith()` or `toHaveBeenCalledWith()` (`prefer-called-with`)

ðŸ’¼ This rule is enabled in the following
[configs](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest/blob/main/README.md#shareable-configurations):
`all`.

<!-- end rule header -->

The `toBeCalled()` matcher is used to assert that a mock function has been
called one or more times, without checking the arguments passed. The assertion
is stronger when arguments are also validated using the `toBeCalledWith()`
matcher. When some arguments are difficult to check, using generic match like
`expect.anything()` at least enforces number and position of arguments.

This rule warns if the form without argument checking is used, except for `.not`
enforcing a function has never been called.

## Rule details

The following patterns are warnings:

```js
expect(someFunction).toBeCalled();

expect(someFunction).toHaveBeenCalled();
```

The following patterns are not warnings:

```js
expect(noArgsFunction).toBeCalledWith();

expect(roughArgsFunction).toBeCalledWith(expect.anything(), expect.any(Date));

expect(anyArgsFunction).toBeCalledTimes(1);

expect(uncalledFunction).not.toBeCalled();
```
